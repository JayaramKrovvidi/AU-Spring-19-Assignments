Difference Between Factory Pattern and Abstract Factory Pattern

Definition:
Factory pattern is a creational pattern that uses a method to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created. 
Abstract factory pattern, on the other hand, is a pattern that provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes. 
Thus, these definitions explain the main difference between factory pattern and abstract factory pattern.

Hiding the Construction
Another difference between factory pattern and abstract factory pattern is that the factory pattern hides the construction of a single object 
while abstract factory pattern hides the construction of a family of related objects.

Conclusion
Factory pattern and Abstract Factory pattern are two creational design patterns. 
Factory pattern provides a method of creating objects without specifying the exact class used to create it. 
In contrast, abstract factory pattern provides a method to combine a group of individual factories without specifying their concrete classes. 
Therefore, this is the main difference between factory pattern and abstract factory pattern.
